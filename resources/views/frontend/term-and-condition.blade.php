We receive and store information you enter on our Websites, provide to us at our stores, or give to us in any other way.

                <p>We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services.

No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. We provide these third party links as part of our effort to provide you with news and events information or for your convenience. The inclusion of these links does not imply our endorsement of the companies, their websites, or their products and services. The links of websites (such as brac.net) we include in our web pages have separate and independent privacy policies. We have no control over these websites and, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organisations (that operate those linked websites) may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal details.

Your activity with these tools is governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>
